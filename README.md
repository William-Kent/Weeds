# Weeds Object Detection and Image Classification Project
Gardeners Friend project for 42028 Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Introduction
Weeds are a constant headache for the professional farmer and the occasional gardener alike. Weeds compete with more desirable plants for moisture, sunlight and nutrients in paddocks, fields, lawns, garden beds and vegetable patches alike. Weeds reduce crop yields, can poison livestock and tarnish the suburban garden. Weed control costs countless hours, and millions of dollars, each year for many. 

## Aim
This project aims to use computer vision techniques to correctly detect and classify weeds in an image.

## Dataset Details
The CottonWeedDet12 dataset will be used in this project. The dataset can be found [here](https://weed-ai.sydney.edu.au/datasets/2c14915b-0827-4b65-9908-d2a6df0d48f3). The dataset is used under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International ([CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)) licence.

The dataset contains 5,648 RGB images common to fields in the southern US. The dataset contains 9,370 bounding boxes. The images in the dataset were collected throughout June to September 2021 and manually labelled by qualified personnel. The dataset contain 12 classes of weeds. These are:
- eclipta,
- ipmoea indica,
- eleusine indica,
- sida rhombifolia,
- physalis angulata,
- senna obtusifolia,
- amaranthus palmeri,
- euphorbia maculata,
- portulaca oleracea,
- mollugo verticillata,
- amaranthus tuberculatus and
- ambrosia artemisiifolia

## Project Details
A responsive web app will be built to accept images from users and then to provide idenitification and classification of weeds in the image to the user. Further information on the weed will also be provided to users to aid action.

### Responsive Web
The basis of the responsive web design will be based on the template provided by **Gitarth Vaishnav** in github [here](https://github.com/GitarthVaishnav/Basic_Web_App). Templates built using Django 4.1.8.
